                  NFTs took the world by storm back in 2020 and had a major shockwave
                  in not only the tech industry, but the art industry as a whole.
                  People were both fascinated and apalled with this new phenomenon and
                  it was very difficult to go through the internet without seeing a
                  hearing someone mention NFTs. However since then, NFTs have taken a
                  backseat and are currently waiting for their next resurgeance, which
                  is why it is a good time to get ahead and learn about what NFTs even
                  are in the first place. There is a lot of misinformation and
                  misinterperatation going around the common folk about NFTs and what
                  they are, as well as what they truly mean. Lets dive into it.
              </p>
              <h4>WHAT IS AN NFT?</h4>
              <p>
                So lets first discuss what an NFT actually is. For starters, NFTs
                stand for Non-Fungible Tokens, which are digital assets and
                collectibles that are non- interchangeable as no NFT is alike with
                another, resulting in NFTs having a unique value. Unlike Bitcoin or
                Ether(the native cryptocurrency coin to the Ethereum Blockchain
                Network) which are fungible coins as the value between their
                currencies will never change, NFTs cannot be swapped with the same
                value as every single NFT in the market is completely unique and
                digitally scarce. NFTs are essentially just pieces of code(a smart
                contract) that is owned and held by a specific address. This address
                will possess a digital passkey that will point to a server that will
                host an image, gif, etc that this address owns. So it isnt aboout
                the collectible itself neccessarily, but the code that runs it.
                Pretty simple and straightforward!
              </p>
              <h4>AUTHENTICITY AND OWNERSHIP</h4>
              <p>
                Lets get into a major part of NFT technology and a part that many of
                the common folk seem to miss(not hating just pointing it out), and
                NFTs are not necessarilty about the collectible itself, it
                is about the code and how it grants ownership of that specific
                digital asset while ensuring its secrurity and authenticity. See
                when you prchase an NFT, you are essentially buying the rights to
                own that NFT, and when you "mint" an NFT(which simply means to
                generate or create a NFT of your own), you are generating a unique
                digital token with a unique digital token ID. Whenever you mint,
                buy, or sell an NFT, that transaction is recorded and timestamped
                the Blockchain with the information of the addresses that
                the NFT, minted the NFT, and sold the NFT. Meaning that
                anyone can verify the authenticity and ownership of an NFT be going
                to the Blockchain and checking for themselves as all activity on the
                Blockchain, including NFTs, is traceable. It is fairly simple and
                easy to check authenticity as only those that own the real and
                authentic NFT can actually sell the NFT, and that even if someone
                were to lets say take a screenshot(a common arguement people have
                against NFTs) of said NFT, it would not mean anything as they are
                not the true and real owners of that NFT which again, is a unique
                token ID. This entire system is crucial as it protects owners and
                creators from purchasing and transfering forgeries and fraud, and
                ensures that participants are buying and selling genuine and
                authentic pieces.
              </p>
              <h4>BENEFITS FOR ARTISTS</h4>
              <p>
                NFTs grant a new path for artists of different backgrounds and styles
                to bring their imagination to life while also being able to benefit
                from Blockchain technology. However in the beautiful world of digital
                art, many artists can face some very challenging and often times
                stress inducing obstacles. One of these being monetization. In a
                digital world, it can be quite difficult for artists to ensure their
                work is not being tampered with, copied, stolen and used for monetary
                gain while they just sit back and deal with it, while also not even
                gaining royalities and or compensation for such things. This is a very
                frustrating and stressful thing that unfortunately many digital
                artists deal with, not to mention how difficult it can be for many
                artists to break into the industry in the first place. However, with
                NFTs and Blockchain, we can help artists combat these obstacles and
                make their lives a bit easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                NFTs and Blockchain would help artists counter the scary obstacle that
                is monetization by allowing artists, creators, musicians, writers etc
                to easily monetize, own, and distribute their work online through
                ownership and authencity. An artist would easily be able to trace and
                track where their art goes and where it ends up. This creates a level
                playing field for artists and allows them to headline their work on a
                global scale and helps them break into the art industry in a safe and
                more secure way. NFTs allow artists to actually have real ownership of
                their creations while gaining compensation for their work and
                protecting their property. By allowing creators and artists control
                and ownership over their work, they cant set the terms and conditions
                as to how their work can be used or sold and to ensure that their work
                is not being appropriated and used without their permission.
              </p>
              <h4>ART</h4>
              <p>
                As mentioned plenty of times earlier in this article, NFTs can and are
                used as digital art. Digital art is the largest and most mainstream
                use case when it comes down to NFTs and for good reason. NFTs can be
                used as a medium for art as artists can mint NFTs to represent their
                own work such as paintings, drawings, collages, images etc, and
                their own creative work with Blockchain Technology in order
                to create a unique form of digital art. Just like more traditional
                forms of digital art, NFT Art has an infinite range as you can
                encompass whatever art style and design as you wish.
              </p>
              <h4>MUSIC</h4>
              <p>
                Many people believe that the only use case for NFTs is digital art,
                and the reality that NFTs can be used for far more and a great example
                would be music. The music industry is clearly a large entertainment
                sector and is very prominent in society and culture. However, many do
                not realize that music artists don't have it easy. The reality is that
                the vast majority of artists dont have full rights and ownership over
                their own work, and a large percentage of the revenue stream they
                receive goes to their record labels rather than their own pockets.
                This has led to music artists exploring the world of NFTs for a few
                reasons thsu the creationsof Music NFTs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Music NFTs are NFTs that are issued using Blockchain technology and
                are linked to a specific song, album, EP, video etc. Artists can use
                these NFTs to represent their music, concert tickets, merchandise,
                virtual experiences etc to allow their fans and community to buy,
                sell, trade and own something that is directly linked to their
                favorite artists. Purchasing these NFTs can be a way for fans to
                support their favorite artists while allowing artists to be more in
                tune with their fans and generate their own revenue. It allows music
                artists to make an imprint on the blockchain while truly preserving
                their ownership of their own music for good, and also giving their
                fans a direct connection to their work and craft.
              </p>
              <h4>PFPs</h4>
              <p>
                A very popular type of NFT, Picture For Profile NFTS or PFP NFTs for
                short, are exclusive digital images designed to serve as their owners
                profile picture of digital identity in a blockchain ecosystem. In the
                real world, we each have our own digital identiy we go by and in order
                for us to conduct many of our daily tasks, we must have identification
                in order for us to conduct these tasks. IDs also allow us to access
                certain communities, clubs, events etc otherwise we wouldnt be able to
                do so. You see a PFP NFT does the same thing....however it takes it to
                the digital world e.x Metaverse. PFPs allow users and participants to
                create their own digital idenities while granting them access to
                certain groups of their choosing and or liking. PFP NFTs can also
                allow users to choose profiles that speak to them and represent their
                own unique personality! However there is another type of PFP NFT that
                users can create...or should I say generate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Generative PFP NFTs are NFTs that are generate using a set of rules
                and algorithms that the creator specifies using code and artificial
                intelligence. A creator can set the parameters of these NFTs such as
                the color, shape, size, animations, etc and this library of
                characteristics will then be executed by the algorithm, which will
                then produce a collection of images and or animations based on the
                characteristics set by the creator. Generative PFPs allow users to
                create large collections(up to 10,000 NFTs) in a faster manner
                comapred to doing it all one by one, while also giving each NFT its
                own character and unique qualities.
              </p>
              <h4>GAMING</h4>
              <p>
                Gaming NFTs are NFTs that are associated with any digital item that is
                used in a gaming ecosystem and enviornment. This inlcudes characters,
                skins, maps, points, weapons, customizations, different game modes,
                anything that is used within a gaming enviornment. Gaming NFTs, just
                like with any other type of NFT, allow the user to authentically own
                and manage their purchases and items. One problem the gaming world and
                its gamers face today is the facilitation of in game items and
                purchases. The majority of video games today do not allow for
                purchases or aquisitions in a game to be transferable to other game
                enviornements. Your ownership of that item is soley adapted to the
                specific game itself, and once the game goes, so do your items and
                purchases as they are non transferable, which of course means you have
                to start over. Another thing to note or keep in mind is that your in
                game items and purchases can be stripped away from you by the
                developers and company behind the game, and you really wouldnt be able
                to do much about it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gaming NFTs can offer provable ownership of in game item purchases and
                allow gamers to buy, sell, and trade these items as due to the unique
                nature of NFTs, said items have digital scarcity and provide value and
                potential monetary gain. Another potential benefit to Gaming NFTs is
                the potential interopability between different gaming ecosystems and
                enviornements. Meaning one day we could potential have Mario racing
                Sonic in the same game enviornement, pretty neat! Now keep in mind
                Gaming NFTs are a big work in progress, and they got a long way to go
                before it gets established as a strong sector within this industry.
                However, the potential is most certainly there and it is quite
                interesting to think about how far it is going to go.
              </p>
              <h4>MEMBERSHIP</h4>
              <p>
                Membership NFTs grant users access to clubs, communities, utilities,
                ecosystems etc in the digital world of Blockchain Technology, just
                like a real world membership plan, pass or ID. Membership NFTs have
                been getting some traction lately and can be incorporated into
                multiple ecosystems within the world of Blockchain and even other NFT
                types. And by of course utilizing Blockchain technology and smart
                contracts, Membership NFTs can provide some real world benefits and
                utility. By replacing traditional paper based memebrship cards with an
                NFT, users and owners can store said NFT in their crypto wallet and
                use that NFT as a ID or passcode to get into a exclusive club or
                community, while also allowing businesses and companies to charge
                upfront costs or micro payments for access to their club, all being
                done by smart contracts(see "What is Blockchain" article). Membership
                NFTs also eliminate the potential or fraud and forgery as instead of
                relying on passcodes, physical cards, and documents, all of which are
                forged and copied on a daily basis, NFTs allow users to store their
                membership and ID digitally on the Blockchain in a safe and secure way
                using cryptography in the form of encrypted tokens. On top of that, if
                a company wishes to validate the authenticity of a memebrship, they
                can easily do so by looking at the blockchain for themselves.
              </p>
              <h4>PHOTOGRAPHY</h4>
              <p>
                Photography NFTs are pretty straightfoward and simple. They are
                photographs taken by photographers that are represented by an NFT and
                put on the Blockchain just like any other NFT. Photgraphy NFTs are one
                of the newest kinds of NFTs in the market and allow Photgraphers, just
                like any other artists using NFTs, to gain true monetization over
                their work.
              </p>
              <h4>DOMAINS</h4>
              <p>
                Domain NFTs function pretty similar to a domain name in the
                traditional web while utilizing Blockchain Technology. In the web
                world, whenever you wish to deploy a website to the internet, one of
                the first things you must do is buy a domain name from a host. Of
                course just like many other things that I have already mentioned, you
                do not truly own this domain name and have to go through a Domain Name
                System, This of course is a concern for bloggers, business owners,
                creators etc as their property can be stripped away from them, and
                also while they are under this domain name, their personal data is a
                bit of a concern. With a Domain NFT, your data is stored on the
                blockchain and these domain names translate into wallet addresses, and
                is essentially used as a shortcut to your wallet. Domain NFTs allow
                users to own their data on the web and helps them avoid going through
                third party services like a Domain Name System and allows users to
                truly take control of the domain they aquired.
