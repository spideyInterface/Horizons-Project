          I am sure you have heard the term "minting" before not only in crypto
        and blockchain, but also in the financial sector. The term "minting" is
        not entirely exclusive to cryptocurrency, as it is a term coined from
        the process of preparing gold and silver that has been mined to coins
        that are then ready to be utilized as a medium of exchange. Not only
        that, "minting" is not just fixed towards NFTs as well. Both Bitcoin and
        Ether for example, utilizing minting however in different ways. In
        Bitcoin, minting is done through mining in a Proof of Work based
        network(more about this in the "What is Blockchain" article). In
        Ethereum, the network utilizes minting through validating in a Proof of
        Stake network and unlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply and
        essentially "unlocks" new coins into circulation, Ethereum does not have
        a fixed supply as its supply is infinite and there will always be new
        Ether being created and added to the Blockchain. When new Ether gets
        added to the blockchain, that Ether is considered to be minted

          <h1 class="aboutMinting_box_title">What does it really mean to mint?</h1>
          <p class="aboutMinting_box_para">
           Minting an NFT is a core fundamental aspect of NFTs and the technology
        behind it. One of the few arguements people have against NFTs is that
        they believe they can "just take a screenshot" of the NFT and sell it
        that way. While you can theroretically do so, it does not mean anything.
        When you mint an NFT, you are generating a unique digital token that
        gets recorded onto the Blockchain network. This is where the authentcity
        and ownership of the NFT is established and anyone can easily verify who
        owns a specific NFT. Due to this, and many other aspects of Blockchain
        technology, NFTs are completely unique and validated. The time it takes
        to actually mint an NFT is dependant on how much metadata the NFT
        contains and how large of a collection you are minting. A single mint
        can take up to 30 minutes on average, while a larger collection may take
        longer. Remember this is all dependant on how much gas youa're willing
        to pay for the transaction, but more on that later in this article!

          <p class="aboutMinting_box_para">
            Anyone can mint an NFT. That goes for creators, artists, investors,
        hobbyists etc. Minting allows creators to deploy their work to the
        online web while also establishing ownership and scarcity while having
        full control over their work and publishing. As foro investors and
        collectors, minting provides a way to gain early access to exclusive
        work that will be valuable over time, as well as providing equal
        opportunity for collectors and investors no matter where you are or come
        from. Minting allows for limitless creativity with a strong and robust
        technological base.

          <h1 class="aboutMinting_box_title">What are Gas Fees?</h1>
            <p class="FourthParagraph">
        Now you have most likely come across the term "gas" or "gas fees" by
        now, whether you were minting or buying an NFT or browsing around the
        Ethereum sector. Gas plays a pivotal role in not only NFTs but the
        Ethereum Blockchain as a whole. Gas is the prive value a user must pay
        whenever they are creating a transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain
        network, or interacting with or deploying a smart contract. Everything
        that is going on within the Blokcchain network requires computation, and
        this computation is done by all the validators participating in the
        network. In order to give the validators incentive for using their
        computational resources and funds to validate transactions and
        facilitate the network, they are paid compensation, and this
        compensation comes in the form of gas fees. Gas is essentially what
        powers and allows the network to run and without it, there would be no
        Ethereum Blockchain network to begin with.
      </p>
      <p class="FourthParagraphPt2">
        Now that is what the term "gas" means. But what does "gas limit" and
        "gas price" mean? Well thank you for asking. They are actually pretty
        simple and straightforward. You see all the activity being done on the
        Ethereum Blokchain network doesn't just run on infintes amount of gas.
        You can't just use all the gas you want whenever you send out a
        transaction and or deploy a smart contract to the network. Ethereum has
        a quite interesting and parculiar way of handling gas and the
        transactions going around the network. Every block in the Ethereum
        mainnet has a gas cap or gas limit, in which it fixes the amount of gas
        that block can contain. Currently, that limit is now set at a 30 million
        gas limit and this sets the cap on the maximum computational effort it
        takes to process transactions and smart contracts in a single block.
        "Wow thats a lot of Ether!". Well no not really, as gas is calculated in
        gwei, which is a denominator of Ether. Now a gas limit is set by the
        user, and that gas limit will tell all the validators in the network how
        much work you are expecting them to do in order to validate your
        transaction. The higher the gas limit set, the higher the gas price.
        Note that although you pay a higher gas fee when you set a higher limit,
        the validators within the network will prioritize your transaction over
        a transaction with a lower gas limit as the compensation for that
        transaction is higher, therefore ensuring your transaction will get
        handled faster. Also, despite each block having a gas cap at 30 million
        gwei, the target gas limit is around 15 million gwei. When blocks
        contain more than 15 million gwei, the base fee for the next block will
        increase. When the block contains less than 15 million gwei, the base
        fee for the next block decreases. This method essentially creates a
        pendulum swing in which Ethereum moves. When a block contains more than
        the 15 million gas target, the fees for having transactions done for the
        next block will be too high for many users to comfortably pay, resulting
        in a reduction in the amount of transactions included in the block. The
        result is usually a block that contains less than the 15 million target
        gas limit, thereby reducing and balancing out the gas fees once again.
      </p>
      <p class="FourthParagraphPt3">
        The next concept of gas is the gas price. Again, this term is actually
        very simple and straightforward. When you think of a gas limit, you can
        essentially think of it as the amount of liters and gallons your car can
        contain. Once you decide on how many liters or gallons you need or want,
        you then have to pay the required price for the amount of gallons or
        liters you are using. The amount of liters and gallons is the gas limit,
        and the amount you have to pay is the gas price. This all may sound like
        a lot, but once you get the swing of it, it is very easy to remember!
        Computation comes at a price!

          With all this information you have read, I hope you received a good
          understanding as to what NFTs are and what they can potentially mean
          for artists, investors, and creators alike. This is an ever changing
          and evolving space as it is still a new technology and has so much
          growth potential. On top of that, the communities in this space are
          growing larger and more passionate about what is here and what is to
          come. So don't be afraid to jump on board and potentially get in
          early. If you are curious about some more subjects and topics about
