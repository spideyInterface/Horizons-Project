                I am sure you have heard the term "minting" before not only in crypto
                and blockchain, but also in the financial sector. The term "minting" is
                not entirely exclusive to cryptocurrency, as it is a term coined from
                the process of preparing gold and silver that has been mined to coins
                that are then ready to be utilized as a medium of exchange. Not only
                that, "minting" is not just fixed towards NFTs as well. Both Bitcoin and
                Ether for example, utilizing minting however in different ways. In
                Bitcoin, minting is done through mining in a Proof of Work based
                network(more about this in the "What is Blockchain" article). In
                Ethereum, the network utilizes minting through validating in a Proof of
                Stake network and unlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply and
                essentially "unlocks" new coins into circulation, Ethereum does not have
                a fixed supply as its supply is infinite and there will always be new
                Ether being created and added to the Blockchain. When new Ether gets
                added to the blockchain, that Ether is considered to be minted.
              </p>
              <h4>WHAT IS MINTING?</h4>
              <p>
                Minting an NFT is a core fundamental aspect of NFTs and the technology
                behind it. One of the few arguements people have against NFTs is that
                believe they can "just take a screenshot" of the NFT and sell it
                that way. While you can theroretically do so, it does not mean anything.
                When you mint an NFT, you are generating a unique digital token that
                gets recorded onto the Blockchain network. This is where the authentcity
                and ownership of the NFT is established and anyone can easily verify who
                owns a specific NFT. Due to this, and many other aspects of Blockchain
                technology, NFTs are completely unique and validated. The time it takes
                to actually mint an NFT is dependant on how much metadata the NFT
                contains and how large of a collection you are minting. A single mint
                can take up to 30 minutes on average, while a larger collection may take
                longer. Remember this is all dependant on how much gas youa're willing
                to pay for the transaction, but more on that later in this article!
              </p>
              <h4>WHO CAN MINT?</h4>
              <p>
                Anyone can mint an NFT. That goes for creators, artists, investors,
                hobbyists etc. Minting allows creators to deploy their work to the
                online web while also establishing ownership and scarcity while having
                full control over their work and publishing. As foro investors and
                collectors, minting provides a way to gain early access to exclusive
                work that will be valuable over time, as well as providing equal
                opportunity for collectors and investors no matter where you are or come
                from. Minting allows for limitless creativity with a strong and robust
                technological base.
              </p>
              <h4>WHAT ARE GAS FEES?</h4>
              <p>
                Now you have most likely come across the term "gas" or "gas fees" by
                now, whether you were minting or buying an NFT or browsing around the
                Ethereum sector. Gas plays a pivotal role in not only NFTs but the
                Ethereum Blockchain as a whole. Gas is the prive value a user must pay
                whenever they are creating a transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain
                network, or interacting with or deploying a smart contract. Everything
                that is going on within the Blokcchain network requires computation, and
                this computation is done by all the validators participating in the
                network. In order to give the validators incentive for using their
                computational resources and funds to validate transactions and
                facilitate the network, they are paid compensation, and this
                compensation comes in the form of gas fees. Gas is essentially what
                powers and allows the network to run and without it, there would be no
                Ethereum Blockchain network to begin with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that is what the term "gas" means. But what does "gas limit" and
                "gas price" mean? Well thank you for asking. They are actually pretty
                simple and straightforward. You see all the activity being done on the
                Ethereum Blokchain network doesn't just run on infintes amount of gas.
                You can't just use all the gas you want whenever you send out a
                transaction and or deploy a smart contract to the network. Ethereum has
                a quite interesting and parculiar way of handling gas and the
                transactions going around the network. Every block in the Ethereum
                mainnet has a gas cap or gas limit, in which it fixes the amount of gas
                that block can contain. Currently, that limit is now set at a 30 million
                gas limit and this sets the cap on the maximum computational effort it
                takes to process transactions and smart contracts in a single block.
                "Wow thats a lot of Ether!". Well no not really, as gas is calculated in
                gwei, which is a denominator of Ether. Now a gas limit is set by the
                user, and that gas limit will tell all the validators in the network how
                much work you are expecting them to do in order to validate your
                transaction. The higher the gas limit set, the higher the gas price.
                Note that although you pay a higher gas fee when you set a higher limit,
                the validators within the network will prioritize your transaction over
                a transaction with a lower gas limit as the compensation for that
                transaction is higher, therefore ensuring your transaction will get
                handled faster. Also, despite each block having a gas cap at 30 million
                gwei, the target gas limit is around 15 million gwei. When blocks
                contain more than 15 million gwei, the base fee for the next block will
                increase. When the block contains less than 15 million gwei, the base
                fee for the next block decreases. This method essentially creates a
                pendulum swing in which Ethereum moves. When a block contains more than
                the 15 million gas target, the fees for having transactions done for the
                next block will be too high for many users to comfortably pay, resulting
                in a reduction in the amount of transactions included in the block. The
                result is usually a block that contains less than the 15 million target
                gas limit, thereby reducing and balancing out the gas fees once again.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next concept of gas is the gas price. Again, this term is actually
                very simple and straightforward. When you think of a gas limit, you can
                essentially think of it as the amount of liters and gallons your car can
                contain. Once you decide on how many liters or gallons you need or want,
                you then have to pay the required price for the amount of gallons or
                liters you are using. The amount of liters and gallons is the gas limit,
                and the amount you have to pay is the gas price. This all may sound like
                a lot, but once you get the swing of it, it is very easy to remember!
                Computation comes at a price!
