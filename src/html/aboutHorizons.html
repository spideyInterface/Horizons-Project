         I love art. Simple and straightforward. And I always have. I grew up in
        a very artistic and creative family with my mother and grandmother being
        the center of it all. I remember sitting beside my mother every week or
        so wathching her paint and draw, and just being fascinated by every
        stroke, how she would blend colors, what brushes she would use, the mess
        she would make and how her hands would be a colorful mess after she was
        done creating a beautiful painting after hours of work. I remember
        watching my grandmother make jewelry whenever we would go visit her on
        the weekends, and her showing me her collection of vinyl records and my
        grandfathers retro posters. I remember looking forward to my art classes
        while I was in school, and exceling in these classes and getting my
        teachers and classmates attention with the drawing I made, or the
        ceramic project I somehow managed to concoct. I remember always be so
        fascincated by color schemes, architectural designs, the shape and
        silouhettes of clothing, the interior design of rooms and buildings, the
        makeup people would wear, the jewelry I would see on wrists and necks,
        the code I would see a programmer develop, and the list goes on. I have
        always been a creative minded individual and nothing has changed as art
        and creativity is a part of who I am and how I go about life. It is not
        a conscious or pretentious decision, it is just how it is. But I am not
        the only one. I am a grain in the sahara desert. In this world, lies
        community and a sense of belonging and something that brings us
        together. That something is present amongst all walks of life whether
        natural or artificial, created or as is. And that is art.

          <h1 class="aboutHorizons_box_title">Why was Horizons created?</h1>
          <p class="aboutHorizons_box_para">
           Back in 2020, I was like many people in the world and was taken back by
        this new phenomenon known as Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. These two
        concepts and technologies completely took the workd by storm and was all
        over headlines, news, commercials, social media, financial outlets,
        campuses, offices, and it goes on and on. The buzz of the next new wave
        of technology was something hard to ignore, and along with my love for
        art, I always had a appreciation for good and useful technology, so I
        decided to delve in. And immediately, I was fascinated and hooked. I
        became extremely interested and invested in learning about Blockchain,
        what it is, how it works, what it can be used for etc and delved into
        many interesting concepts and projects(Ethereum being the big one). All
        of a sudden this concept of NFTs reached the surface and completely
        exploded in society, and once I found out what it was, I was like a kid
        in a candy store!
          </p>
          <p class="aboutHorizons_box_para">
            See I absoutely love and adore digital art and animation. It has always
        been a passion of mine and its probably my favorite form of art there
        is. So when I found out that this new technology of NFTs can bridge the
        world between not only digital art, but art, assets and collectibles as
        a whole, my mind was blown. I went into a NFT rabbit hole and took it
        from there. Fast forward to the present, I began my journey as a
        Blockchain Developer and what better project for me to make than an NFT
        Marketplace? And here we are. Simply put, Horizons was created as an
        extension of my love for art and technology, and a way for me to
        showcase such to the world, whether big or small. And it's fun too...

          <h1 class="aboutHorizons_box_title">The core of it</h1>

        Blokcchain Network, and is a place where users can mint, buy, sell, and
        explore various forms/types of NFTs. Horizons allows artists, investors,
        and creators to have creative and financial freedom, while giving its

          <h1 class="aboutHorizons_box_title">Inspirations</h1>
              <p class="aboutHorizons_box_para">
        I did not just want to copy other NFT Marketplaces and create a
        application that looked and felt very similar to others within this
        industry. Like all forms of art, it is a personal telling of your
        personality and ideas that you possess, and the stories that follow
        them. By taking this approach, I created a application and Marketplace
        that is a extension of my personality and the layout of my creativity
        and well....my style!.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutHorizons_box_para">
        Horizons takes inspiration from the opulence and richness of luxurious
        color palettes and designs, while advancing on contemporary and avant
        garde layouts with a animated atmosphere, while still embracing bright
        and vibrant colors. I wanted to make Horizons feel like your eyes were
        walking through a precious and beautiful art gallery in a animated and
        interactive digital world. Sharp designs with neutral tones, 3d
        transitions and animations, colorful and dark art displays and galleries
        etc while being tied and in tune with the end goal of Horizons, which is
        to allow creators and artists to explore the world of NFTs.

      <p class="aboutHorizons_box_para">
        No matter what background you come from, what art and colelctible style
        or category you enjoy, no matter where you are in the world, you can
        create and invest yourself within Horizons. No limits.

          With all this information you have read, I hope you received a good
          understanding as to what NFTs are and what they can potentially mean
          for artists, investors, and creators alike. This is an ever changing
          and evolving space as it is still a new technology and has so much
          growth potential. On top of that, the communities in this space are
          growing larger and more passionate about what is here and what is to
          come. So don't be afraid to jump on board and potentially get in
