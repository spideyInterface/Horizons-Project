          <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
         When it comes down to conducting transactions in crypto world, we all
        need a place to store our funds and required information in order to
        conduct these transactions in the network, and this where wallets come
        in, in particular...... crypto wallets. In the real world, we use
        wallets to store our mediums of exchange such as credits cards, debit
        cards, and cash along with our IDs such as our drivers license and
        membership cards. In the crypto world, we do the same, except our
        wallets are digital and have some technical differences because of that.
        Lets get into it!
          </p>

          <h1 class="aboutWallet_box_title">What exactly is a crypto wallet?</h1>
          <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
           So lets first discuss what a crypto wallet actually is and what it
        actually stores. Believe it or not, a crypto wallet doesnt actually
        store cryptocurrency...SHOCKER! You see your funds are actually stored
        on the blockchain itself, and your crypto wallet stores the digital
        passkeys needed for you to ACCCESS your funds on that blockchain. These
        two digital pass keys are known as your public key and your private key.
        Whats that mean for you? Well lets see.
          </p>

          <h1 class="aboutWallet_box_title">What is cryptography?</h1>
          <img src="https://images4.alphacoders.com/130/1303494.jpeg" alt="BlockchainDiagram2" class="whatIsBlockchainImg" />
          <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
            Before we get into what a public and private key are, we first must
        understand what cryptography is as a whole, and no, cryptography is not
        jsut specific to crypto and Blockchain despite having the word crypto in
        it. Cryptography has been in the tech and web developement world for a
        long time now, and plays a vital role in how we manage to send and
        receive information and data across databases and servers in a safe and
        secure manner. Cryptography is the art and science of converting human
        readable text into computer code, with the sole purpose and reason of
        ensuring information and data does not get exploited and tampered with
        by anyone who isnt validated to see that pieces of information and or
        message. Cryptography comes down to two essential techniques, them being
        encryption and decryption.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
             Encryption is the process of converting human readable text called plain
        text, into computer code called cipher text, with the purpose of
        ensuring anyone who doesnt have authorization to see that message or
        piece of information can access it. The only way to see an encrypted
        message is by utilization of a digital passkey to that message, and this
        digital passkey will be held and used by the recipient of that message.
        This digital passkey will decrypt the message. What is decryption?
        Decryption is the opposite of encryption, in which in decryption, it is
        the process of converting computer code, which again, is called cipher
        text, back into its original form which is human readable text, which
        again, is called plain text. These two techniques ensure that
        information and data can be sent around networks in a safe and secure
        manner, and to ensure that we as users can be confident in storing and
        sending said information whenever we are dealing with databases and
        servers. That said, not all databases and networks are created equal and
        not all have secrurity standards such as cryptography up to par, so make
        sure you are getting involved with reputable and strong databases and
        networks. In Blockchain, we use two different types of cryptography;
        Asymetric Key Encryption(also known as Public Key Cryptography) and
        Hashing Functions.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
            Asymetric Key Encryption is when two digital passkeys are required to
        encrypt and decrypt a message and unlike Symetric Key Encryption(also
        known as Private Key Cryptography) which you use your private key to
        both encrypt and decrypt a message, these two digital passkeys are not
        interchangeable and you cannot use one in replacement for the other. In
        order to encrypt a message, you use your public key. In order to decrypt
        a message, you use your private key.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
             Along with Asymetric Key Encryption, we also use hashing functions as a
        form of cryptography. Hashing is the process of using a mathematical
        equation or algorithm to convert an input of arbitrary length into an
        output of a fixed length, and the same data and input will always
        produce the same output and value. Since hashes are a fixed lenght, its
        nearly impossible for a bad actor to guess the hash if someone was
        trying to tamper with a blockchain, and since the input of a hash will
        always produce the same output, everytime a bad actor changes anything
        about the hash of a block, the entire hash itself will change entirely,
        further ensuring its secrurity and robustness. Alogn with all this,
        hashing makes data location easier to manage.

          <h1 class="aboutWallet_box_title">What is a public key?</h1>
            <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
         Public keys are the digital passkeys we use to encrypt a transaction
        that is sent to a recipient across the network, in order to ensure it is
        secure and unexploitable. Along with this, in the world of Blockchain,
        our public key is what we use to verify the digital signature of the
        sender for the transaction. A public key is publicly viewable and used
        information that anyone can access and utilize. Think of a public key as
        your username or email address. Anyone that has access to these pieces
        of information can send funds or information to your account, however
        they will not be able to actually access your account. This is where
        your private key comes in.
      </p>  
    </div>

    <div class="aboutWallet_box_box">

          <h1 class="aboutWallet_box_title">What is a private key?</h1>
            <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
         Public keys are the digital passkeys we use to encrypt a transaction

        your private key comes in.
      </p>  
       <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
        You can think of private keys as your password or secure login
        information. You wouldn't go around showing people the password to your
        bank account would you? Would you go around showing the password to your
        cashapp account? Or email address? I would hope not. Thats because this
        is sensible information that only you are supposed to be able to access
        and see, and anyone that has access to this information will be able to
        access the information and funds to your account. So private keys, as
        the name suggests, are meant to only be seen by you and should never be
        seen by anyone else other than yourself. So never, ever, ever share your
        private key! Along with keeping your private key safe, you should also
        keep your seed phrase safe. Whenever you create a new crypto wallet, it
        will generate a unique seed phrase for you to copy and write down, as it
        is a human readable representation of your private key and is used as a
        mnemonic backup phrase to gain access to your account and wallet
        whenever you lose your wallet. In case you do lose your wallet, your
        seed phrase will regenerate your private key and all the funds in your
        wallet. So keep your seed phrase stored safely and practice remembering
        it!

          <h1 class="aboutWallet_box_title">Types of wallets?</h1>
          <h3 class="aboutWallet_box_title_title">Software</h3>
            <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
         Software wallets are arguably the most widely used and known type of
        crypto wallets out there. A software wallet is a digital extension and
        or application that is always connected to the internet, providing ease
        of access to by, sell, trade, stake, borrow, lend, and hold
        cryptocurrencies and NFTs. These wallets are regarded as "cold" wallets
        as they always depend on internet connection in order to run. However,
        because these wallets are always connected to the internet as they
        inherently need internet connection in order to operate, they are also
        the most succeptible to online hacks and attacks. So although these
        attacks are still generally rare, it is something to keep in mind. The
        most popular software crypto wallet in the world is Metamask. Metamask
        is an Ethereum based blockchain wallet that runs in your browser, and
        provides an easy and convienient way to store and handle ERC tokens and
        coins.
      </p>  
      <h3 class="aboutWallet_box_title_title">Hardware</h3>
       <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
       Hardware wallets are regarded to be the most secure and stable wallet to
        hold your private keys, and these wallets are regarded as "hot walelts".
        A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores private keys and
        funds both offline and online. Unlike software wallets, which need
        internet connection in order to operate, hardware wallets do not need
        web connection in order to effectively stor your data. Your funds and
        private keys are safe and secure within these wallets as it is
        impossible for a hacker or bad actor to exploit a wallet that is not
        connected to the internet, and along with that, these wallets require
        you to sign in whenever it is actually being utilized. In order to
        conduct transactions or update the hardware, you simply connect your
        hardware wallet to your computer, sign in using your passkey and carry
        on as normal. Once you disconnect your hardware wallet form your
        computer, the walelt automatically disconnects from your computer and
        the internet, ensuring your data is secure. The two obvious downsides to
        a hardware wallet are that it is physical, meaning it can be physically
        lost and or broken. And two, that it is not as convienient and fast to
        use as a software wallet, as the initial login requires more work and
        steps on your part. Still, so long as you remember and or keep your seed
        phrase and passkey safe and hidden, you would be able to regenerate your
        data and private keys if you do manage to lose your hardhware wallet.
      </p>
      <h3 class="aboutWallet_box_title_title">Paper</h3>
      <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
        Paper keys are very simple and straightforward. Paper keys are physical
        pieces of paper that users will either print or write their private and
        public keys, along with the addresses and seed phrases that come with
        their account. Downsides are pretty obvious and quite drastic. For
        starters, you can physically lose the paper and thereofre lose access to
        your account for good. On top of that, the ink of the paper can fade
        over time making it more and more difficult to read and understand and
        you also run the risk of having your paper get caught in bad weather
        such as rain or snow, making it unreadable. Although paper wallets are
        technically secure, they may not be the most up to date and best modern
        choice for storing such precious information such as your keys and seed
        phrase.

        <p class="aboutWallet_box_para">
          With all this information you have read, I hope you received a good
          understanding as to what NFTs are and what they can potentially mean
          for artists, investors, and creators alike. This is an ever changing
          and evolving space as it is still a new technology and has so much
          growth potential. On top of that, the communities in this space are
          growing larger and more passionate about what is here and what is to
          come. So don't be afraid to jump on board and potentially get in
          early. If you are curious about some more subjects and topics about
