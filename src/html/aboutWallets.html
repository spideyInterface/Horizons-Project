                When it comes down to conducting transactions in crypto world, we all
                need a place to store our funds and required information in order to
                conduct these transactions in the network, and this where wallets come
                in, in particular...... crypto wallets. In the real world, we use
                wallets to store our mediums of exchange such as credits cards, debit
                cards, and cash along with our IDs such as our drivers license and
                membership cards. In the crypto world, we do the same, except our
                wallets are digital and have some technical differences because of that.
                Lets get into it!
                </p>
                <h4>WHAT IS A CRYPTO WALLET?</h4>
                <p>
                So lets first discuss what a crypto wallet actually is and what it
                actually stores. Believe it or not, a crypto wallet doesnt actually
                store cryptocurrency...SHOCKER! You see your funds are actually stored
                on the blockchain itself, and your crypto wallet stores the digital
                passkeys needed for you to ACCCESS your funds on that blockchain. These
                two digital pass keys are known as your public key and your private key.
                Whats that mean for you? Well lets see.
                </p>
                <h4>WHAT IS CRYPTOGRAPHY?</h4>
                <p>
                Before we get into what a public and private key are, we first must
                understand what cryptography is as a whole, and no, cryptography is not
                just specific to crypto and Blockchain despite having the word crypto in
                it. Cryptography has been in the tech and web developement world for a
                long time now, and plays a vital role in how we manage to send and
                receive information and data across databases and servers in a safe and
                secure manner. Cryptography is the art and science of converting human
                readable text into computer code, with the sole purpose and reason of
                ensuring information and data does not get exploited and tampered with
                by anyone who isnt validated to see that pieces of information and or
                message. Cryptography comes down to two essential techniques, them being
                encryption and decryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                Encryption is the process of converting human readable text called plain
                text, into computer code called cipher text, with the purpose of
                ensuring anyone who doesnt have authorization to see that message or
                piece of information can access it. The only way to see an encrypted
                message is by utilization of a digital passkey to that message, and this
                digital passkey will be held and used by the recipient of that message.
                This digital passkey will decrypt the message. What is decryption?
                Decryption is the opposite of encryption, in which in decryption, it is
                the process of converting computer code, which again, is called cipher
                text, back into its original form which is human readable text, which
                again, is called plain text. These two techniques ensure that
                information and data can be sent around networks in a safe and secure
                manner, and to ensure that we as users can be confident in storing and
                sending said information whenever we are dealing with databases and
                servers. That said, not all databases and networks are created equal and
                not all have secrurity standards such as cryptography up to par, so make
                sure you are getting involved with reputable and strong databases and
                networks. In Blockchain, we use two different types of cryptography;
                Asymetric Key Encryption(also known as Public Key Cryptography) and
                Hashing Functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                Asymetric Key Encryption is when two digital passkeys are required to
                encrypt and decrypt a message and unlike Symetric Key Encryption(also
                known as Private Key Cryptography) which you use your private key to
                both encrypt and decrypt a message, these two digital passkeys are not
                interchangeable and you cannot use one in replacement for the other. In
                order to encrypt a message, you use your public key. In order to decrypt
                a message, you use your private key.
                </p>
                <p>
                Along with Asymetric Key Encryption, we also use hashing functions as a
                form of cryptography. Hashing is the process of using a mathematical
                equation or algorithm to convert an input of arbitrary length into an
                output of a fixed length, and the same data and input will always
                produce the same output and value. Since hashes are a fixed lenght, its
                nearly impossible for a bad actor to guess the hash if someone was
                trying to tamper with a blockchain, and since the input of a hash will
                always produce the same output, everytime a bad actor changes anything
                about the hash of a block, the entire hash itself will change entirely,
                further ensuring its secrurity and robustness. Alogn with all this,
                hashing makes data location easier to manage.
                </p>
                <h4>WHAT IS A PUBLIC KEY?</h4>
                <p>
                Public keys are the digital passkeys we use to encrypt a transaction
                that is sent to a recipient across the network, in order to ensure it is
                secure and unexploitable. Along with this, in the world of Blockchain,
                our public key is what we use to verify the digital signature of the
                sender for the transaction. A public key is publicly viewable and used
                information that anyone can access and utilize. Think of a public key as
                your username or email address. Anyone that has access to these pieces
                of information can send funds or information to your account, however
                they will not be able to actually access your account. This is where
                your private key comes in.
                </p>
                <h4>WHAT IS A PRIVATE KEY?</h4>
                <p>
                Public keys are the digital passkeys we use to encrypt a transaction
                that is sent to a recipient across the network, in order to ensure it is
                secure and unexploitable. Along with this, in the world of Blockchain,
                our public key is what we use to verify the digital signature of the
                sender for the transaction. A public key is publicly viewable and used
                information that anyone can access and utilize. Think of a public key as
                your username or email address. Anyone that has access to these pieces
                of information can send funds or information to your account, however
                they will not be able to actually access your account. This is where
                your private key comes in.
                </p>
                <p>
                You can think of private keys as your password or secure login
                information. You wouldn't go around showing people the password to your
                bank account would you? Would you go around showing the password to your
                cashapp account? Or email address? I would hope not. Thats because this
                is sensible information that only you are supposed to be able to access
                and see, and anyone that has access to this information will be able to
                access the information and funds to your account. So private keys, as
                the name suggests, are meant to only be seen by you and should never be
                seen by anyone else other than yourself. So never, ever, ever share your
                private key! Along with keeping your private key safe, you should also
                keep your seed phrase safe. Whenever you create a new crypto wallet, it
                will generate a unique seed phrase for you to copy and write down, as it
                is a human readable representation of your private key and is used as a
                mnemonic backup phrase to gain access to your account and wallet
                whenever you lose your wallet. In case you do lose your wallet, your
                seed phrase will regenerate your private key and all the funds in your
                wallet. So keep your seed phrase stored safely and practice remembering
                it!
                </p>
                <h4>SOFTWARE</h4>
                <p>
                Software wallets are arguably the most widely used and known type of
                crypto wallets out there. A software wallet is a digital extension and
                or application that is always connected to the internet, providing ease
                of access to by, sell, trade, stake, borrow, lend, and hold
                cryptocurrencies and NFTs. These wallets are regarded as "cold" wallets
                as they always depend on internet connection in order to run. However,
                because these wallets are always connected to the internet as they
                inherently need internet connection in order to operate, they are also
                the most succeptible to online hacks and attacks. So although these
                attacks are still generally rare, it is something to keep in mind. The
                most popular software crypto wallet in the world is Metamask. Metamask
                is an Ethereum based blockchain wallet that runs in your browser, and
                provides an easy and convienient way to store and handle ERC tokens and
                coins.
                </p>
                <h4>HARDWARE</h4>
                <p>
                Hardware wallets are regarded to be the most secure and stable wallet to
                hold your private keys, and these wallets are regarded as "hot walelts".
                A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores private keys and
                funds both offline and online. Unlike software wallets, which need
                internet connection in order to operate, hardware wallets do not need
                web connection in order to effectively stor your data. Your funds and
                private keys are safe and secure within these wallets as it is
                impossible for a hacker or bad actor to exploit a wallet that is not
                connected to the internet, and along with that, these wallets require
                you to sign in whenever it is actually being utilized. In order to
                conduct transactions or update the hardware, you simply connect your
                hardware wallet to your computer, sign in using your passkey and carry
                on as normal. Once you disconnect your hardware wallet form your
                computer, the walelt automatically disconnects from your computer and
                the internet, ensuring your data is secure. The two obvious downsides to
                a hardware wallet are that it is physical, meaning it can be physically
                lost and or broken. And two, that it is not as convienient and fast to
                use as a software wallet, as the initial login requires more work and
                steps on your part. Still, so long as you remember and or keep your seed
                phrase and passkey safe and hidden, you would be able to regenerate your
                data and private keys if you do manage to lose your hardhware wallet.
                </p>
                <h4>PAPER</h4>
                <p>
                Paper keys are very simple and straightforward. Paper keys are physical
                pieces of paper that users will either print or write their private and
                public keys, along with the addresses and seed phrases that come with
                their account. Downsides are pretty obvious and quite drastic. For
                starters, you can physically lose the paper and thereofre lose access to
                your account for good. On top of that, the ink of the paper can fade
                over time making it more and more difficult to read and understand and
                you also run the risk of having your paper get caught in bad weather
                such as rain or snow, making it unreadable. Although paper wallets are
                technically secure, they may not be the most up to date and best modern
                choice for storing such precious information such as your keys and seed
                phrase.
