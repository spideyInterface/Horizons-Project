              <p>
                Now I am sure many of you might be wondering what Blockchain is in the
                first place and how it works and what it means for you and your pockets.
                After all, you are spending funds in order to create, trade, sell and
                purchase these NFTs, so I am sure you are eager and tempted to
                understand and get a grip on what the technology that even makes this
                posissible is in the first place. Well, here you go.
              </p>
              <h4>WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?</h4>
              <p>
                Blockchain Technology is a distributed ledger and database that stores
                transactions, information, and data into bundles of records called
                blocks. These blocks are then chained in chronological order in order to
                form an immuatable and tamper proof database. Blockchain runs on a
                decentralized peer to peer network, meaning instead of there being one
                central authority that is governing the entire network, the network is
                made up of many different participants that are spread across the globe
                and these participants are refered to as nodes. Each node has an equal
                responsibility in maintaining the secrurity and stability of the network
                while also being responsible for validating and verifying pieces of
                information, data and transactions being transfered across the network.
              </p>
              <h4>WHY BLOCKCHAIN?</h4>
              <p>
                Blockchain does not function the same as other more traditional
                databases. As stated already, blockchains are not owned by a single
                entity as the power and computation is spread across multiple
                participants and because of this, Blockchain encompassses some very
                interesting and downright great technology. Lets get into it!
              </p>
              <h4>CONSENSUS</h4>
              <p>
                Consensus plays a very vital role in how Blockchains operate and
                function, and is the sole reason why all these nodes participating in
                the network can even validate and very transactions within unit in the
                first place. Consensus is the process of coming to an agreement in order
                to make a decision. And in Blockchain, that means that in order for a
                new transaction and or piece of data to be put onto the main chain, all
                of the participating nodes within the network must first come to a
                agreement and conclusion that this piece of data is authorized to be on
                chain. Once these nodes within the network verify this piece of data to
                be secure and authorized, it is then validated, put into a block, and
                then recorded on the blockchain.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two types of consensus mechanisms/systems that are
                currently used in Blockchain Technology. First we have the original
                blockchain consensus mechanism(and the most outdated)which is named
                Proof of Work which was introduced by Bitcoin back in 2009. In a
                Proof of Work based network, all of the participating nodes within
                the network are called miners. These miners are using their
                computational power and energy resources to solve a very complex
                mathematical equation/algorithm which is attempting to solve the
                hash to the new block being added. Whichever miner solves this
                mathematical algorithm first, mines the new block onto the chain and
                gets rewarded for it. This is the process of mining. Although Proof
                of Work is a fairly secure architectural structure for Blockchain,
                it does have some drawbacks. The main drawback being it is very
                energy intensive and resource demanding. See these miners that are
                mining new blocks onto the chain arent small pieces of software.
                They are massive pieces of machinery(and thousands of them running
                at once) that are using laods of energy to solve a very complex
                mathematical equation taht requires a ton of computational power.
                Due to this, many blockchains are moving away from Proof of Work and
                to the new kid on the block....Proof of Stake.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next and newest consensus mechanism is called Proof of Stake.
                Proof of Stake was introduced by Ethereum back in 2022 to solve the
                energy and scalibility problem Proof of Work was facing. In a Proof
                of Stake network, the nodes running the network are validators
                instead of miners. What does that mean? Well its fairly simple and
                straightforward. In a Proof of Stake architecture, the network will
                pick validators based on how many native coins or tokens
                participants stake within the blockchain ecosystem. Whichever
                participants are staking the most coins/tokens, gets picked as a
                validator and gets rewarded staking rewards. Because there is no
                mathematical equation involved, the energy needed to compute and
                validate these transactions and data gets reduced significantly
                while allowing the transaction speed to increase. Now you are
                probably wondering, how do you even stake in the first place? Well
                its actually fairly simple and far easier them you think! All you
                have to do is choose an exchange, then choose a coin/token that is
                based on a Proof of Stake architecture, and aquire a specified
                amount of coins or tokens according to the requirements of the
                protocol, and then lock up those funds into that protocol for a set
                period of time. Once you get picked as a validator in the network,
                you will start to earn staking rewards. This is essentially
                compensation that the Blockchain is giving you for allowing the
                network to use your coins/tokens to facilitate and run the network!
                Its a win win!
              </p>
              <h4>SMART CONTRACTS</h4>
              <p>
                Smart Contracts are one of the core fundamental aspects of Blockchain
                Technology and plays a vital role in not only the functionality of
                Blockchain, but also what it can do. Smart Contracts are complex pieces
                of code and software progam that are built alongside a blockchain
                network. Once the predetermined conditions of this contractual agreement
                are met, the contract and code is automatically executed. It is a way to
                eliminate the need for outside third party services and intermediaries
                to manage and oversee data, information, funds accounts, contracts etc
                and moving from a trust based system in which you have to trust a third
                party service to handle data, to a fully autonomous system once the
                contract is deployed onto the blockchain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Practically everything you see in Blockchain has been touched by a smart
                contract, interacts with one, or IS a Smart Contract and this includes
                NFTs! Yes the NFT you are eyeing or have purchased is in fact a smart
                contract built using a specific standard, but more about that in the
                "What is an NFT" page.
              </p>
              <h4>DECENTRALIZATION</h4>
              <p>
                As mentioned earlier, decentralization is a integral part of blockchain
                technology, and allows databases to operate in a trustless manner in
                which anyone and everyone participating in the network can have access
                to the same real time data and information. It distributes the
                responsibility and power evently amongst network participants and
                because of this, the network becomes a very robust and secure databse.
                However despite all of this, keep in mind that not all data has to be
                stored in a blockchain and that blockchain has a spectrum of
                decentralization, So choose wisely!
              </p>
              <h4>SECURITY</h4>
              <p>
                Blockchain Technology is a very secure and stable databse and this comes
                down to a few reasons. For starters, since all the data within a
                Blockchain network is distributed among multiple participants instead of
                just one central authority, there is no central point of failure which
                in turn makes it very difficult for these networks to be attacked and
                also makes it very difficult for an entire Blockchain network to go
                down( which is why Blockchain runs 24/7/no downtime). Another component
                that makes Blockchain very robust is the fact that it utilizes
                cryptographic principles with Asymmetric Key Encryption, which allows
                data to be held and sent in a secure and safe manner while ensuring data
                secrurity and authentication.
              </p>
              <h4>IMMUTABILITY</h4>
              <p>
                All Blockchain Technology, no matter if its Public, Private, Hybrid,
                Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple and so on and
                so forth, is immutable and tamper proof. Whenever data gets validated
                onto the chain, it is stored there forever as is. You cannot change,
                delete tamper with, or alter data and information that has been added to
                a block on chain as each block is encrypted with its data finalized.
                This ensures that all activity on the Blockchain gets recorded making
                Blockchain a reliable and dependant database to store various kinds of
                information. You cannot lie in Blockchain as anyone can go check the
                activity for themselves. Honesty is the best policy.
              </p>
              <h4>TRUSTLESS</h4>
              <p>
                Since Blockchain is ran by different nodes participating in the network
                with computation and software, the network does not require you to gain
                any type of permission in order to view or interact with the Blockchain
                as most Blockchains are censorship free with no gatekeepers choosing who
                can participate and access the network. Now keep in mind not all
                blockchains are completely decentralized and open source, as some
                blockchain networks are Private therefore have a preselected amount of
                users that control and govern the entire network, and do not allow those
                outside of this group to access or oversee the chain. Some Blockchain
                networks run on a Hybrid Blockchain which consists of Public and Private
                techniques and provides a middle ground as a Hybrid network tends to be
                ran by one authority or pre selected users, however incorporates some
                decentralization processes within the network via applications, smart
                contracts etc. Nevertheless, most Blockchain networks out there are open
                source databases, in which anyone and everyone can access and interact
                with the network while also being able to see the activity going on
                within the databse.
