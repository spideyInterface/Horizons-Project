            Now I am sure many of you might be wondering what Blockchain is in the
        first place and how it works and what it means for you and your pockets.
        After all, you are spending funds in order to create, trade, sell and
        purchase these NFTs, so I am sure you are eager and tempted to
        understand and get a grip on what the technology that even makes this
        posissible is in the first place. Well, here you go.

          <h1 class="aboutBlockchain_box_title">What exactly is Blockchain</h1>
          <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
           Blockchain Technology is a distributed ledger and database that stores
        transactions, information, and data into bundles of records called
        blocks. These blocks are then chained in chronological order in order to
        form an immuatable and tamper proof database. Blockchain runs on a
        decentralized peer to peer network, meaning instead of there being one
        central authority that is governing the entire network, the network is
        made up of many different participants that are spread across the globe
        and these participants are refered to as nodes. Each node has an equal
        responsibility in maintaining the secrurity and stability of the network
        while also being responsible for validating and verifying pieces of
        information, data and transactions being transfered across the network.

          <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
            Blockchain does not function the same as other more traditional
        databases. As stated already, blockchains are not owned by a single
        entity as the power and computation is spread across multiple
        participants and because of this, Blockchain encompassses some very
        interesting and downright great technology. Lets get into it!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="aboutBlockchain_box_box">
          <img src="https://images4.alphacoders.com/130/1303494.jpeg" alt="ConsensusImage1" class="whatIsNftImg" />
          <h3 class="aboutBlockchain_box_title_title">Consensus</h3>
          <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
            Consensus plays a very vital role in how Blockchains operate and
        function, and is the sole reason why all these nodes participating in
        the network can even validate and very transactions within unit in the
        first place. Consensus is the process of coming to an agreement in order
        to make a decision. And in Blockchain, that means that in order for a
        new transaction and or piece of data to be put onto the main chain, all
        of the participating nodes within the network must first come to a
        agreement and conclusion that this piece of data is authorized to be on
        chain. Once these nodes within the network verify this piece of data to
        be secure and authorized, it is then validated, put into a block, and
        then recorded on the blockchain.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
            There are two types of consensus mechanisms/systems that are
            currently used in Blockchain Technology. First we have the original
            blockchain consensus mechanism(and the most outdated)which is named
            Proof of Work which was introduced by Bitcoin back in 2009. In a
            Proof of Work based network, all of the participating nodes within
            the network are called miners. These miners are using their
            computational power and energy resources to solve a very complex
            mathematical equation/algorithm which is attempting to solve the
            hash to the new block being added. Whichever miner solves this
            mathematical algorithm first, mines the new block onto the chain and
            gets rewarded for it. This is the process of mining. Although Proof
            of Work is a fairly secure architectural structure for Blockchain,
            it does have some drawbacks. The main drawback being it is very
            energy intensive and resource demanding. See these miners that are
            mining new blocks onto the chain arent small pieces of software.
            They are massive pieces of machinery(and thousands of them running
            at once) that are using laods of energy to solve a very complex
            mathematical equation taht requires a ton of computational power.
            Due to this, many blockchains are moving away from Proof of Work and
            to the new kid on the block....Proof of Stake.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
            The next and newest consensus mechanism is called Proof of Stake.
            Proof of Stake was introduced by Ethereum back in 2022 to solve the
            energy and scalibility problem Proof of Work was facing. In a Proof
            of Stake network, the nodes running the network are validators
            instead of miners. What does that mean? Well its fairly simple and
            straightforward. In a Proof of Stake architecture, the network will
            pick validators based on how many native coins or tokens
            participants stake within the blockchain ecosystem. Whichever
            participants are staking the most coins/tokens, gets picked as a
            validator and gets rewarded staking rewards. Because there is no
            mathematical equation involved, the energy needed to compute and
            validate these transactions and data gets reduced significantly
            while allowing the transaction speed to increase. Now you are
            probably wondering, how do you even stake in the first place? Well
            its actually fairly simple and far easier them you think! All you
            have to do is choose an exchange, then choose a coin/token that is
            based on a Proof of Stake architecture, and aquire a specified
            amount of coins or tokens according to the requirements of the
            protocol, and then lock up those funds into that protocol for a set
            period of time. Once you get picked as a validator in the network,
            you will start to earn staking rewards. This is essentially
            compensation that the Blockchain is giving you for allowing the
            network to use your coins/tokens to facilitate and run the network!
            Its a win win!

        <img src="https://images4.alphacoders.com/130/1303494.jpeg" alt="Smart-ContractImage" class="whatIsNftImg" />
        <h3 class="aboutBlockchain_box_title_title">Smart Contract</h3>
        <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
         Smart Contracts are one of the core fundamental aspects of Blockchain
        Technology and plays a vital role in not only the functionality of
        Blockchain, but also what it can do. Smart Contracts are complex pieces
        of code and software progam that are built alongside a blockchain
        network. Once the predetermined conditions of this contractual agreement
        are met, the contract and code is automatically executed. It is a way to
        eliminate the need for outside third party services and intermediaries
        to manage and oversee data, information, funds accounts, contracts etc
        and moving from a trust based system in which you have to trust a third
        party service to handle data, to a fully autonomous system once the
        contract is deployed onto the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
          Practically everything you see in Blockchain has been touched by a smart
        contract, interacts with one, or IS a Smart Contract and this includes
        NFTs! Yes the NFT you are eyeing or have purchased is in fact a smart
        contract built using a specific standard, but more about that in the
        "What is an NFT" page.

        <h3 class="aboutBlockchain_box_title_title">Decentralization</h3>
        <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
          As mentioned earlier, decentralization is a integral part of blockchain
        technology, and allows databases to operate in a trustless manner in
        which anyone and everyone participating in the network can have access
        to the same real time data and information. It distributes the
        responsibility and power evently amongst network participants and
        because of this, the network becomes a very robust and secure databse.
        However despite all of this, keep in mind that not all data has to be
        stored in a blockchain and that blockchain has a spectrum of
        decentralization, So choose wisely!
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutBlockchain_box_title_title">Security</h3>
        <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
         Blockchain Technology is a very secure and stable databse and this comes
        down to a few reasons. For starters, since all the data within a
        Blockchain network is distributed among multiple participants instead of
        just one central authority, there is no central point of failure which
        in turn makes it very difficult for these networks to be attacked and
        also makes it very difficult for an entire Blockchain network to go
        down( which is why Blockchain runs 24/7/no downtime). Another component
        that makes Blockchain very robust is the fact that it utilizes
        cryptographic principles with Asymmetric Key Encryption, which allows
        data to be held and sent in a secure and safe manner while ensuring data
        secrurity and authentication.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="aboutBlockchain_box_title_title">Immutability</h3>
        <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
          All Blockchain Technology, no matter if its Public, Private, Hybrid,
        Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple and so on and
        so forth, is immutable and tamper proof. Whenever data gets validated
        onto the chain, it is stored there forever as is. You cannot change,
        delete tamper with, or alter data and information that has been added to
        a block on chain as each block is encrypted with its data finalized.
        This ensures that all activity on the Blockchain gets recorded making
        Blockchain a reliable and dependant database to store various kinds of
        information. You cannot lie in Blockchain as anyone can go check the
        activity for themselves. Honesty is the best policy
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="aboutBlockchain_box_title_title">Trustless</h3>
       <p class="aboutBlockchain_box_para">
        Since Blockchain is ran by different nodes participating in the network
        with computation and software, the network does not require you to gain
        any type of permission in order to view or interact with the Blockchain
        as most Blockchains are censorship free with no gatekeepers choosing who
        can participate and access the network. Now keep in mind not all
        blockchains are completely decentralized and open source, as some
        blockchain networks are Private therefore have a preselected amount of
        users that control and govern the entire network, and do not allow those
        outside of this group to access or oversee the chain. Some Blockchain
        networks run on a Hybrid Blockchain which consists of Public and Private
        techniques and provides a middle ground as a Hybrid network tends to be
        ran by one authority or pre selected users, however incorporates some
        decentralization processes within the network via applications, smart
        contracts etc. Nevertheless, most Blockchain networks out there are open
        source databases, in which anyone and everyone can access and interact
        with the network while also being able to see the activity going on
        within the databse.
