              <p>
                I love art. Simple and straightforward. And I always have. I grew up in
                a very artistic and creative family with my mother and grandmother being
                the center of it all. I remember sitting beside my mother every week or
                so wathching her paint and draw, and just being fascinated by every
                stroke, how she would blend colors, what brushes she would use, the mess
                she would make and how her hands would be a colorful mess after she was
                done creating a beautiful painting after hours of work. I remember
                watching my grandmother make jewelry whenever we would go visit her on
                the weekends, and her showing me her collection of vinyl records and my
                grandfathers retro posters. I remember looking forward to my art classes
                while I was in school, and exceling in these classes and getting my
                teachers and classmates attention with the drawing I made, or the
                ceramic project I somehow managed to concoct. I remember always be so
                fascincated by color schemes, architectural designs, the shape and
                silouhettes of clothing, the interior design of rooms and buildings, the
                makeup people would wear, the jewelry I would see on wrists and necks,
                the code I would see a programmer develop, and the list goes on. I have
                always been a creative minded individual and nothing has changed as art
                and creativity is a part of who I am and how I go about life. It is not
                a conscious or pretentious decision, it is just how it is. But I am not
                the only one. I am a grain in the sahara desert. In this world, lies
                community and a sense of belonging and something that brings us
                together. That something is present amongst all walks of life whether
                natural or artificial, created or as is. And that is art.
              </p>
              <h4>WHY WAS HORIZONS CREATED?</h4>
              <p>
                Back in 2020, I was like many people in the world and was taken back by
                this new phenomenon known as Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. These two
                concepts and technologies completely took the workd by storm and was all
                over headlines, news, commercials, social media, financial outlets,
                campuses, offices, and it goes on and on. The buzz of the next new wave
                of technology was something hard to ignore, and along with my love for
                art, I always had a appreciation for good and useful technology, so I
                decided to delve in. And immediately, I was fascinated and hooked. I
                became extremely interested and invested in learning about Blockchain,
                what it is, how it works, what it can be used for etc and delved into
                many interesting concepts and projects(Ethereum being the big one). All
                of a sudden this concept of NFTs reached the surface and completely
                exploded in society, and once I found out what it was, I was like a kid
                in a candy store!
              </p>
              <p>
                See I absoutely love and adore digital art and animation. It has always
                been a passion of mine and its probably my favorite form of art there
                is. So when I found out that this new technology of NFTs can bridge the
                world between not only digital art, but art, assets and collectibles as
                a whole, my mind was blown. I went into a NFT rabbit hole and took it
                from there. Fast forward to the present, I began my journey as a
                Blockchain Developer and what better project for me to make than an NFT
                Marketplace? And here we are. Simply put, Horizons was created as an
                extension of my love for art and technology, and a way for me to
                showcase such to the world, whether big or small. And it's fun too...
              </p>
              <h4>THE CORE OF IT?</h4>
              <p>
                Horizons is an NFT marketplace that is built on top of the Sepolia
                Blokcchain Network, and is a place where users can mint, buy, sell, and
                explore various forms/types of NFTs. Horizons allows artists, investors,
                and creators to have creative and financial freedom, while giving its
                users control and authority over their own work or investments. Horizons
                welcomes users from all backgrounds and parts of the world, as well as
                welcoming expansion and growth. Horizons is not just meant to be a
                marketplace, but a community that users cannot wait to step into.
              </p>
              <h4>INSPIRATIONS</h4>
              <p>
                I did not just want to copy other NFT Marketplaces and create a
                application that looked and felt very similar to others within this
                industry. Like all forms of art, it is a personal telling of your
                personality and ideas that you possess, and the stories that follow
                them. By taking this approach, I created a application and Marketplace
                that is a extension of my personality and the layout of my creativity
                and well....my style!.
              </p>
              <p>
                Horizons takes inspiration from the opulence and richness of luxurious
                color palettes and designs, while advancing on contemporary and avant
                garde layouts with a animated atmosphere, while still embracing bright
                and vibrant colors. I wanted to make Horizons feel like your eyes were
                walking through a precious and beautiful art gallery in a animated and
                interactive digital world. Sharp designs with neutral tones, 3d
                transitions and animations, colorful and dark art displays and galleries
                etc while being tied and in tune with the end goal of Horizons, which is
                to allow creators and artists to explore the world of NFTs.
              </p>
              <p>
                No matter what background you come from, what art and colelctible style
                or category you enjoy, no matter where you are in the world, you can
                create and invest yourself within Horizons. No limits.
