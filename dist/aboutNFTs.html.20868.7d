          <h1 class="aboutNft_box_title">What are NFTs</h1>
          <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
            NFTs took the world by storm back in 2020 and had a major shockwave
            in not only the tech industry, but the art industry as a whole.
            People were both fascinated and apalled with this new phenomenon and
            it was very difficult to go through the internet without seeing a
            hearing someone mention NFTs. However since then, NFTs have taken a
            backseat and are currently waiting for their next resurgeance, which
            is why it is a good time to get ahead and learn about what NFTs even
            are in the first place. There is a lot of misinformation and
            misinterperatation going around the common folk about NFTs and what
            they are, as well as what they truly mean. Lets dive into it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="aboutNft_box_box">
          <img src="https://images4.alphacoders.com/130/1303494.jpeg" alt="BlockchainDiagram1" class="whatIsNftImg">
          <h1 class="aboutNft_box_title">What exactly is an NFT?</h1>
          <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
            So lets first discuss what an NFT actually is. For starters, NFTs
            stand for Non-Fungible Tokens, which are digital assets and
            collectibles that are non- interchangeable as no NFT is alike with
            another, resulting in NFTs having a unique value. Unlike Bitcoin or
            Ether(the native cryptocurrency coin to the Ethereum Blockchain
            Network) which are fungible coins as the value between their
            currencies will never change, NFTs cannot be swapped with the same
            value as every single NFT in the market is completely unique and
            digitally scarce. NFTs are essentially just pieces of code(a smart
            contract) that is owned and held by a specific address. This address
            will possess a digital passkey that will point to a server that will
            host an image, gif, etc that this address owns. So it isnt aboout
            the collectible itself neccessarily, but the code that runs it.
            Pretty simple and straightforward!
          </p>

          <h1 class="aboutNft_box_title">What makes NFTs special?</h1>
          <img src="https://images4.alphacoders.com/130/1303494.jpeg" alt="BlockchainDiagram2" class="whatIsBlockchainImg">
          <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
            Now you are probably asking, "Ok cool I know what NFTs are now!
            Thanks random stranger! But whyyyyyy even use these in the first
            place.?" Well thanks for asking! There are multiple benefits for
            owning, creating, or selling NFTs and some are benefits that many
            people are not fully aware of. NFTs go beyond just being pieces of
            digital art you sell online. Lets see how.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="aboutNft_box_box">

          <h1 class="aboutNft_box_title">Authencity and Ownership</h1>
          <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
            Lets get into a major part of NFT technology and a part that many of
            the common folk seem to miss(not hating just pointing it out), and
            its that NFTs are not necessarilty about the collectible itself, it
            is about the code and how it grants ownership of that specific
            digital asset while ensuring its secrurity and authenticity. See
            when you prchase an NFT, you are essentially buying the rights to
            own that NFT, and when you "mint" an NFT(which simply means to
            generate or create a NFT of your own), you are generating a unique
            digital token with a unique digital token ID. Whenever you mint,
            buy, or sell an NFT, that transaction is recorded and timestamped
            onto the Blockchain with the information of the addresses that
            bought the NFT, minted the NFT, and sold the NFT. Meaning that
            anyone can verify the authenticity and ownership of an NFT be going
            to the Blockchain and checking for themselves as all activity on the
            Blockchain, including NFTs, is traceable. It is fairly simple and
            easy to check authenticity as only those that own the real and
            authentic NFT can actually sell the NFT, and that even if someone
            were to lets say take a screenshot(a common arguement people have
            against NFTs) of said NFT, it would not mean anything as they are
            not the true and real owners of that NFT which again, is a unique
            token ID. This entire system is crucial as it protects owners and
            creators from purchasing and transfering forgeries and fraud, and
            ensures that participants are buying and selling genuine and
            authentic pieces.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
            There are two types of consensus mechanisms/systems that are
            currently used in Blockchain Technology. First we have the original
            blockchain consensus mechanism(and the most outdated)which is named
            Proof of Work which was introduced by Bitcoin back in 2009. In a
            Proof of Work based network, all of the participating nodes within
            the network are called miners. These miners are using their
            computational power and energy resources to solve a very complex
            mathematical equation/algorithm which is attempting to solve the
            hash to the new block being added. Whichever miner solves this
            mathematical algorithm first, mines the new block onto the chain and
            gets rewarded for it. This is the process of mining. Although Proof
            of Work is a fairly secure architectural structure for Blockchain,
            it does have some drawbacks. The main drawback being it is very
            energy intensive and resource demanding. See these miners that are
            mining new blocks onto the chain arent small pieces of software.
            They are massive pieces of machinery(and thousands of them running
            at once) that are using laods of energy to solve a very complex
            mathematical equation taht requires a ton of computational power.
            Due to this, many blockchains are moving away from Proof of Work and
            to the new kid on the block....Proof of Stake.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
            The next and newest consensus mechanism is called Proof of Stake.
            Proof of Stake was introduced by Ethereum back in 2022 to solve the
            energy and scalibility problem Proof of Work was facing. In a Proof
            of Stake network, the nodes running the network are validators
            instead of miners. What does that mean? Well its fairly simple and
            straightforward. In a Proof of Stake architecture, the network will
            pick validators based on how many native coins or tokens
            participants stake within the blockchain ecosystem. Whichever
            participants are staking the most coins/tokens, gets picked as a
            validator and gets rewarded staking rewards. Because there is no
            mathematical equation involved, the energy needed to compute and
            validate these transactions and data gets reduced significantly
            while allowing the transaction speed to increase. Now you are
            probably wondering, how do you even stake in the first place? Well
            its actually fairly simple and far easier them you think! All you
            have to do is choose an exchange, then choose a coin/token that is
            based on a Proof of Stake architecture, and aquire a specified
            amount of coins or tokens according to the requirements of the
            protocol, and then lock up those funds into that protocol for a set
            period of time. Once you get picked as a validator in the network,
            you will start to earn staking rewards. This is essentially
            compensation that the Blockchain is giving you for allowing the
            network to use your coins/tokens to facilitate and run the network!
            Its a win win!

        <h1 class="aboutNft_box_title">Benefits for Artists</h1>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          NFTs grant a new path for artists of different backgrounds and styles
          to bring their imagination to life while also being able to benefit
          from Blockchain technology. However in the beautiful world of digital
          art, many artists can face some very challenging and often times
          stress inducing obstacles. One of these being monetization. In a
          digital world, it can be quite difficult for artists to ensure their
          work is not being tampered with, copied, stolen and used for monetary
          gain while they just sit back and deal with it, while also not even
          gaining royalities and or compensation for such things. This is a very
          frustrating and stressful thing that unfortunately many digital
          artists deal with, not to mention how difficult it can be for many
          artists to break into the industry in the first place. However, with
          NFTs and Blockchain, we can help artists combat these obstacles and
          make their lives a bit easier.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          NFTs and Blockchain would help artists counter the scary obstacle that
          is monetization by allowing artists, creators, musicians, writers etc
          to easily monetize, own, and distribute their work online through
          ownership and authencity. An artist would easily be able to trace and
          track where their art goes and where it ends up. This creates a level
          playing field for artists and allows them to headline their work on a
          global scale and helps them break into the art industry in a safe and
          more secure way. NFTs allow artists to actually have real ownership of
          their creations while gaining compensation for their work and
          protecting their property. By allowing creators and artists control
          and ownership over their work, they cant set the terms and conditions
          as to how their work can be used or sold and to ensure that their work
          is not being appropriated and used without their permission.

        <h1 class="aboutNft_box_title">How NFTs are used</h1>
        <h3 class="aboutNft_box_title_title">Art</h3>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          As mentioned plenty of times earlier in this article, NFTs can and are
          used as digital art. Digital art is the largest and most mainstream
          use case when it comes down to NFTs and for good reason. NFTs can be
          used as a medium for art as artists can mint NFTs to represent their
          own work such as paintings, drawings, collages, images etc, and
          integrate their own creative work with Blockchain Technology in order
          to create a unique form of digital art. Just like more traditional
          forms of digital art, NFT Art has an infinite range as you can
          encompass whatever art style and design as you wish.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutNft_box_title_title">Music</h3>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          Many people believe that the only use case for NFTs is digital art,
          and the reality that NFTs can be used for far more and a great example
          would be music. The music industry is clearly a large entertainment
          sector and is very prominent in society and culture. However, many do
          not realize that music artists don't have it easy. The reality is that
          the vast majority of artists dont have full rights and ownership over
          their own work, and a large percentage of the revenue stream they
          receive goes to their record labels rather than their own pockets.
          This has led to music artists exploring the world of NFTs for a few
          reasons thsu the creationsof Music NFTs.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          Music NFTs are NFTs that are issued using Blockchain technology and
          are linked to a specific song, album, EP, video etc. Artists can use
          these NFTs to represent their music, concert tickets, merchandise,
          virtual experiences etc to allow their fans and community to buy,
          sell, trade and own something that is directly linked to their
          favorite artists. Purchasing these NFTs can be a way for fans to
          support their favorite artists while allowing artists to be more in
          tune with their fans and generate their own revenue. It allows music
          artists to make an imprint on the blockchain while truly preserving
          their ownership of their own music for good, and also giving their
          fans a direct connection to their work and craft.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutNft_box_title_title">Picture For Profile(PFP)</h3>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          A very popular type of NFT, Picture For Profile NFTS or PFP NFTs for
          short, are exclusive digital images designed to serve as their owners
          profile picture of digital identity in a blockchain ecosystem. In the
          real world, we each have our own digital identiy we go by and in order
          for us to conduct many of our daily tasks, we must have identification
          in order for us to conduct these tasks. IDs also allow us to access
          certain communities, clubs, events etc otherwise we wouldnt be able to
          do so. You see a PFP NFT does the same thing....however it takes it to
          the digital world e.x Metaverse. PFPs allow users and participants to
          create their own digital idenities while granting them access to
          certain groups of their choosing and or liking. PFP NFTs can also
          allow users to choose profiles that speak to them and represent their
          own unique personality! However there is another type of PFP NFT that
          users can create...or should I say generate.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          Generative PFP NFTs are NFTs that are generate using a set of rules
          and algorithms that the creator specifies using code and artificial
          intelligence. A creator can set the parameters of these NFTs such as
          the color, shape, size, animations, etc and this library of
          characteristics will then be executed by the algorithm, which will
          then produce a collection of images and or animations based on the
          characteristics set by the creator. Generative PFPs allow users to
          create large collections(up to 10,000 NFTs) in a faster manner
          comapred to doing it all one by one, while also giving each NFT its
          own character and unique qualities.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutNft_box_title_title">Gaming</h3>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          Gaming NFTs are NFTs that are associated with any digital item that is
          used in a gaming ecosystem and enviornment. This inlcudes characters,
          skins, maps, points, weapons, customizations, different game modes,
          anything that is used within a gaming enviornment. Gaming NFTs, just
          like with any other type of NFT, allow the user to authentically own
          and manage their purchases and items. One problem the gaming world and
          its gamers face today is the facilitation of in game items and
          purchases. The majority of video games today do not allow for
          purchases or aquisitions in a game to be transferable to other game
          enviornements. Your ownership of that item is soley adapted to the
          specific game itself, and once the game goes, so do your items and
          purchases as they are non transferable, which of course means you have
          to start over. Another thing to note or keep in mind is that your in
          game items and purchases can be stripped away from you by the
          developers and company behind the game, and you really wouldnt be able
          to do much about it.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          Gaming NFTs can offer provable ownership of in game item purchases and
          allow gamers to buy, sell, and trade these items as due to the unique
          nature of NFTs, said items have digital scarcity and provide value and
          potential monetary gain. Another potential benefit to Gaming NFTs is
          the potential interopability between different gaming ecosystems and
          enviornements. Meaning one day we could potential have Mario racing
          Sonic in the same game enviornement, pretty neat! Now keep in mind
          Gaming NFTs are a big work in progress, and they got a long way to go
          before it gets established as a strong sector within this industry.
          However, the potential is most certainly there and it is quite
          interesting to think about how far it is going to go.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutNft_box_title_title">Membership NFTs</h3>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          Membership NFTs grant users access to clubs, communities, utilities,
          ecosystems etc in the digital world of Blockchain Technology, just
          like a real world membership plan, pass or ID. Membership NFTs have
          been getting some traction lately and can be incorporated into
          multiple ecosystems within the world of Blockchain and even other NFT
          types. And by of course utilizing Blockchain technology and smart
          contracts, Membership NFTs can provide some real world benefits and
          utility. By replacing traditional paper based memebrship cards with an
          NFT, users and owners can store said NFT in their crypto wallet and
          use that NFT as a ID or passcode to get into a exclusive club or
          community, while also allowing businesses and companies to charge
          upfront costs or micro payments for access to their club, all being
          done by smart contracts(see "What is Blockchain" article). Membership
          NFTs also eliminate the potential or fraud and forgery as instead of
          relying on passcodes, physical cards, and documents, all of which are
          forged and copied on a daily basis, NFTs allow users to store their
          membership and ID digitally on the Blockchain in a safe and secure way
          using cryptography in the form of encrypted tokens. On top of that, if
          a company wishes to validate the authenticity of a memebrship, they
          can easily do so by looking at the blockchain for themselves.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutNft_box_title_title">Photography NFTs</h3>
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          Photography NFTs are pretty straightfoward and simple. They are
          photographs taken by photographers that are represented by an NFT and
          put on the Blockchain just like any other NFT. Photgraphy NFTs are one
          of the newest kinds of NFTs in the market and allow Photgraphers, just
          like any other artists using NFTs, to gain true monetization over
          their work.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutNft_box_title_title">Domain NFTs
        <p class="aboutNft_box_para">
          Domain NFTs function pretty similar to a domain name in the
          traditional web while utilizing Blockchain Technology. In the web
          world, whenever you wish to deploy a website to the internet, one of
          the first things you must do is buy a domain name from a host. Of
          course just like many other things that I have already mentioned, you
          do not truly own this domain name and have to go through a Domain Name
          System, This of course is a concern for bloggers, business owners,
          creators etc as their property can be stripped away from them, and
          also while they are under this domain name, their personal data is a
          bit of a concern. With a Domain NFT, your data is stored on the
          blockchain and these domain names translate into wallet addresses, and
          is essentially used as a shortcut to your wallet. Domain NFTs allow
          users to own their data on the web and helps them avoid going through
          third party services like a Domain Name System and allows users to
          truly take control of the domain they aquired.

          With all this information you have read, I hope you received a good
          understanding as to what NFTs are and what they can potentially mean
          for artists, investors, and creators alike. This is an ever changing
          and evolving space as it is still a new technology and has so much
          growth potential. On top of that, the communities in this space are
          growing larger and more passionate about what is here and what is to
          come. So don't be afraid to jump on board and potentially get in
          early. If you are curious about some more subjects and topics about
