            When it comes down to conducting transactions in crypto world, we all
            need a place to store our funds and required information in order to
            conduct these transactions in the network, and this where wallets come
            in, in particular...... crypto wallets. In the real world, we use
            wallets to store our mediums of exchange such as credits cards, debit
            cards, and cash along with our IDs such as our drivers license and
            membership cards. In the crypto world, we do the same, except our
            wallets are digital and have some technical differences because of that.
            Lets get into it!

            So lets first discuss what a crypto wallet actually is and what it
            actually stores. Believe it or not, a crypto wallet doesnt actually
            store cryptocurrency...SHOCKER! You see your funds are actually stored
            on the blockchain itself, and your crypto wallet stores the digital
            passkeys needed for you to ACCCESS your funds on that blockchain. These
            two digital pass keys are known as your public key and your private key.
            Whats that mean for you? Well lets see.

          <h1 class="aboutWallets_box_title">WHAT IS CRYPTOGRAPHY?</h1>
          <p class="aboutWallets_box_para">
            Before we get into what a public and private key are, we first must
            understand what cryptography is as a whole, and no, cryptography is not
          just specific to crypto and Blockchain despite having the word crypto in
          it. Cryptography has been in the tech and web developement world for a
          long time now, and plays a vital role in how we manage to send and
          receive information and data across databases and servers in a safe and
          secure manner. Cryptography is the art and science of converting human
          readable text into computer code, with the sole purpose and reason of
          ensuring information and data does not get exploited and tampered with
          by anyone who isnt validated to see that pieces of information and or
          message. Cryptography comes down to two essential techniques, them being
          encryption and decryption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Encryption is the process of converting human readable text called plain
          text, into computer code called cipher text, with the purpose of
          ensuring anyone who doesnt have authorization to see that message or
          piece of information can access it. The only way to see an encrypted
          message is by utilization of a digital passkey to that message, and this
          digital passkey will be held and used by the recipient of that message.
          This digital passkey will decrypt the message. What is decryption?
          Decryption is the opposite of encryption, in which in decryption, it is
          the process of converting computer code, which again, is called cipher
          text, back into its original form which is human readable text, which
          again, is called plain text. These two techniques ensure that
          information and data can be sent around networks in a safe and secure
          manner, and to ensure that we as users can be confident in storing and
          sending said information whenever we are dealing with databases and
          servers. That said, not all databases and networks are created equal and
          not all have secrurity standards such as cryptography up to par, so make
          sure you are getting involved with reputable and strong databases and
          networks. In Blockchain, we use two different types of cryptography;
          Asymetric Key Encryption(also known as Public Key Cryptography) and
          Hashing Functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Asymetric Key Encryption is when two digital passkeys are required to
            encrypt and decrypt a message and unlike Symetric Key Encryption(also
            known as Private Key Cryptography) which you use your private key to
            both encrypt and decrypt a message, these two digital passkeys are not
            interchangeable and you cannot use one in replacement for the other. In
            order to encrypt a message, you use your public key. In order to decrypt
            a message, you use your private key.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with Asymetric Key Encryption, we also use hashing functions as a
            form of cryptography. Hashing is the process of using a mathematical
            equation or algorithm to convert an input of arbitrary length into an
            output of a fixed length, and the same data and input will always
            produce the same output and value. Since hashes are a fixed lenght, its
            nearly impossible for a bad actor to guess the hash if someone was
            trying to tamper with a blockchain, and since the input of a hash will
            always produce the same output, everytime a bad actor changes anything
            about the hash of a block, the entire hash itself will change entirely,
            further ensuring its secrurity and robustness. Alogn with all this,
            hashing makes data location easier to manage.

          <p class="aboutWallets_box_para">
            Public keys are the digital passkeys we use to encrypt a transaction
            that is sent to a recipient across the network, in order to ensure it is
            secure and unexploitable. Along with this, in the world of Blockchain,
            our public key is what we use to verify the digital signature of the
            sender for the transaction. A public key is publicly viewable and used
            information that anyone can access and utilize. Think of a public key as
            your username or email address. Anyone that has access to these pieces
            of information can send funds or information to your account, however
            they will not be able to actually access your account. This is where
            your private key comes in.

        </p>
        <p class="aboutWallets_box_para">
          You can think of private keys as your password or secure login
          information. You wouldn't go around showing people the password to your
          bank account would you? Would you go around showing the password to your
          cashapp account? Or email address? I would hope not. Thats because this
          is sensible information that only you are supposed to be able to access
          and see, and anyone that has access to this information will be able to
          access the information and funds to your account. So private keys, as
          the name suggests, are meant to only be seen by you and should never be
          seen by anyone else other than yourself. So never, ever, ever share your
          private key! Along with keeping your private key safe, you should also
          keep your seed phrase safe. Whenever you create a new crypto wallet, it
          will generate a unique seed phrase for you to copy and write down, as it
          is a human readable representation of your private key and is used as a
          mnemonic backup phrase to gain access to your account and wallet
          whenever you lose your wallet. In case you do lose your wallet, your
          seed phrase will regenerate your private key and all the funds in your
          wallet. So keep your seed phrase stored safely and practice remembering
          it!

        <h1 class="aboutWallets_box_title">SOFTWARE</h1>
        <p class="aboutWallets_box_para">
          Software wallets are arguably the most widely used and known type of
          crypto wallets out there. A software wallet is a digital extension and
          or application that is always connected to the internet, providing ease
          of access to by, sell, trade, stake, borrow, lend, and hold
          cryptocurrencies and NFTs. These wallets are regarded as "cold" wallets
          as they always depend on internet connection in order to run. However,
          because these wallets are always connected to the internet as they
          inherently need internet connection in order to operate, they are also
          the most succeptible to online hacks and attacks. So although these
          attacks are still generally rare, it is something to keep in mind. The
          most popular software crypto wallet in the world is Metamask. Metamask
          is an Ethereum based blockchain wallet that runs in your browser, and
          provides an easy and convienient way to store and handle ERC tokens and
          coins.

        <h1 class="aboutWallets_box_title">HARDWARE</h1>
        <p class="aboutWallets_box_para">
          Hardware wallets are regarded to be the most secure and stable wallet to
          hold your private keys, and these wallets are regarded as "hot walelts".
          A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores private keys and
          funds both offline and online. Unlike software wallets, which need
          internet connection in order to operate, hardware wallets do not need
          web connection in order to effectively stor your data. Your funds and
          private keys are safe and secure within these wallets as it is
          impossible for a hacker or bad actor to exploit a wallet that is not
          connected to the internet, and along with that, these wallets require
          you to sign in whenever it is actually being utilized. In order to
          conduct transactions or update the hardware, you simply connect your
          hardware wallet to your computer, sign in using your passkey and carry
          on as normal. Once you disconnect your hardware wallet form your
          computer, the walelt automatically disconnects from your computer and
          the internet, ensuring your data is secure. The two obvious downsides to
          a hardware wallet are that it is physical, meaning it can be physically
          lost and or broken. And two, that it is not as convienient and fast to
          use as a software wallet, as the initial login requires more work and
          steps on your part. Still, so long as you remember and or keep your seed
          phrase and passkey safe and hidden, you would be able to regenerate your
          data and private keys if you do manage to lose your hardhware wallet.

        <p class="aboutWallets_box_para">
          Paper keys are very simple and straightforward. Paper keys are physical
          pieces of paper that users will either print or write their private and
          public keys, along with the addresses and seed phrases that come with
          their account. Downsides are pretty obvious and quite drastic. For
          starters, you can physically lose the paper and thereofre lose access to
          your account for good. On top of that, the ink of the paper can fade
          over time making it more and more difficult to read and understand and
          you also run the risk of having your paper get caught in bad weather
          such as rain or snow, making it unreadable. Although paper wallets are
          technically secure, they may not be the most up to date and best modern
          choice for storing such precious information such as your keys and seed
          phrase.
